This section is for basic background information that we went over in the first week. 

\Def{Definition}{A\textbf{ partition} $\la$ of $n$ is $\la= (\la_1, \la_2, ..., \la_l)$ where $\la_1 \geq \la_2 \geq ... \geq \la_l \geq 1$ and \\ $\la_1 + \la_2 + \dots + \la_l = n$. Also, $|\la| = \la_1 + \dots + \la_l$. 

- Sometimes we write $\la \vdash n$. 

- $p(n) = \# \{ \text{partitions of} \ n\}$

\thm{Craven}{Given any $N >0$, there exists a multiset $X_N$ such that $$\#\{\lambda \mid \mathcal{H}(\lambda) = X_N\}>N$$
That is, the number of partitions associated with a multiset of hook lengths can get arbitrarily large as we change the multiset.}

\Def{Definition}{The \textbf{conjugate} of a partition $\la$ denoted $\la'$ is the partition whose }
