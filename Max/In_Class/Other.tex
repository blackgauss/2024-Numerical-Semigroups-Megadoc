\Def{Definition}{ The \textbf{type} of $S$ is $|PF(S)| = t(S)$. 

In words, the type is the number of pseudofrobenius numbers.

Note: $t(S) \leq 2g(S) - F(S)$}


\Def{Definition}{

A numerical semigroup $S$ for which $x \in S \iff F(S) - x \not \in S$ is   \textbf{symmetric}. 

A numerical semigroup $S$ is \textbf{pseudo-symmetric} if $F(S)$ is even and $M(S) = \{ \frac{1}{2} F(S) \}.$

If $t(S) = 2g(S) - F(S) $ then $S$ is \textbf{almost symmetric}. 

Note: symmetric $\implies$ almost symmetric.}

Symmetry, type and partitions are closely related:

$M(S) = \emptyset \iff P(S) =1 \iff S$ is symmetric $\iff t(S) = 1 $ 

$|M(S)| = 1 \iff $ $S$ is pseudo-symmetric $ \implies t(S) = 2 \implies P(S) = 2$

$t(S) = 3 \implies P(S) \in \{ 2, 3, 4 \}$
