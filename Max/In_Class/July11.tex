I wrote code that takes all numerical semigroups of a certain genus, prints its generators and the number of edges in it's gap poset to a csv file so it can be easily added to a spreadsheet.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
    def GapPoset(S): #print gap poset        #Modified from VoidPoset which was taken from Deepesh
        GG = S.Gaps()
        L = []
        for i in GG:
            for j in GG:
                if j-i in S:
                    L.append([i,j])
        GP = Poset([GG,L])
        # show(GP)
        return GP

    def GapPosetEdges(S): #prints number of edges in GapPoset 
        GP = GapPoset(S)
        A = GP.cover_relations()
        B = len(A)
        return B

    genus = 
    sgps = NumericalSemigroup.SemigroupsWithGenus(genus)

    L = []
    M = []
    for S in sgps: 
        GE = S.gens
        type(GE)
        a = GapPosetEdges(S)
        b = str(a)
        L.append(GE)
        M.append(b)
    length = len(L)
    with open('/home/samwisega/genusedges.csv', 'w') as file:
        for i in range(length):
            file.write('"')
            file.write(str(L[i]))
            file.write('",')
            file.write(M[i])
            file.write('\n')
\end{lstlisting}
