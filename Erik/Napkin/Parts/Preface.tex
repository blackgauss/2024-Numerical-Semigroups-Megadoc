The purpose of this document is to communicate some ideas from my paper journal in a more readable manner. If you are not me, feel free to give me feedback, spot errors, or take anything you need. This is not intended to be a super formal document so it likely it will accumulate many errors. The section titles will be organized by date but the subsection titles should be helpful in navigating to specific topics.

Shoutout to Kaylee for providing written notes from lectures and group work time in \begin{center} /Kaylee/\textit{big list of everything.tex}\end{center} and a list of research problems in \begin{center} /\textit{Potential Problems.tex}\end{center} Please use the above files for a thorough account of our summer and research goals.
